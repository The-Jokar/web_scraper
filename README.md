This API web scrapper uses the requests library and MarketStack to pull the latest stock market data from today and shows you a visual representation of open, close, and percentage change over the course of the day. It allows you to input as many companies as you want separated by commas up to the limit of the free API, if no input is given then it defaults to all the IT companies in the S&P 500. The information that is gathered is then visualized using MatPlotLib to create an easily interpretable graph.

I am currently updating to implement OAuth to improve security when getting the API access key and updating it so that users can modify more settings, such as looking at historical data, intraday data, and more.
